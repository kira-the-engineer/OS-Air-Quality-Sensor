# OS-Air-Quality-Sensor

## Project Description
 The goal of this project is to create a low cost, relatively accurate air quality sensor in a small form factor. It is inspired by seeing popular air quality sensors like the Aranet and wanting to make something more open source and accessible to people. The sensor chosen is a Sensirion SCD-40, which is a infrared CO2 sensor with an accuracy of +/- 5% for concentrations of CO2 between 400-2000 PPM. It's lower cost than a more accuarate sensor, but good enough to accurately measure air quality in most settings. The carrier board and display for the sensor will be kept small and simple, about the size of a cassette tape. Design constraints for this project were chosen to maintain accuracy while keeping the cost of manufacturing the board under $100.
